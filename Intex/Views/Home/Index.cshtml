        <p>
            For years now, people have been getting yeeted from their cars at high speeds. Government agencies have been trying for years to lower
            driver fatalities in Utah with little success. Our team at Think & Drive has developed special data driven tools to help lawmakers make
            efficient and affective decisions in driving laws.
